# Absolute Paths:
Paths that fully determine the location of a file -- $PATH
- writing a program that runs a program that we want to run from any where:
	- give its absolute path or the name of the command itself so the shell can find it

# Relative path:
Relative to where we currently are -- use pwd to see where we are
All relative paths are relative to where you currently are

. -- current directory
.. -- parent directory
