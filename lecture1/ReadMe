# Absolute Paths:
Paths that fully determine the location of a file -- $PATH
- writing a program that runs a program that we want to run from any where:
	- give its absolute path or the name of the command itself so the shell can find it

# Relative path:
Relative to where we currently are -- use pwd to see where we are
All relative paths are relative to where you currently are

. -- current directory
.. -- parent directory 



cd: 

cd - : it will cd to the previous directory we were in -- we can use this to toggle between different directories 

Flags & Options:

They start with a dash (-)



Mv - rename a file 

Cp - lets us cp a file > cp copyFrom andCopyTo

Use Manual Pages:

For Mac we use man <cmd>


The Power of The shell: comes when we chain programs together and when we start combining different programs

Interacting files with others.

Streams:

Input stream: keyboard input

Output Stream: output from terminal 

The shell allows us to point the input and output is pointed 

< -- rewire the input of providing file to be the contents of this file

> -- rewires the output of the proceeding file "echo hello > hello.txt"

cat - prints the content of a file:  cat hello.txt -- would print hello
	- it also supports <

Cat < hello.txt --- this will take the input from hello.txt, the shell opens hello.txt, takes the content, gives the input to cat and outputs it using cat


Appending: 

>> : appending the text instead of overwrite

Pipe:

 |  - takes the output of the program from the left and makes it the input to the file to the 		right 	

- this allows us to chain commands, works with text and images/video
